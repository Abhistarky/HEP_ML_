# Dataset Exploration

## Context

In this code, we are performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to uncover insights and patterns. The goal is to understand the structure of the data, identify any anomalies, and visualize key features that may influence further analysis or modeling. EDA is a crucial step in the data science workflow as it helps in making informed decisions about data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building.

## Objectives

- **Load the Dataset**: Import the dataset into the environment for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate basic statistics to summarize the data (mean, median, mode, etc.).
- **Data Visualization**: Create visual representations of the data to identify trends and relationships.

## Expected Outcomes

By executing this code, we aim to achieve the following:

1. **Understand Data Distribution**: Gain insights into how different features are distributed across the dataset.
2. **Identify Relationships**: Explore correlations between variables that may affect outcomes.
3. **Prepare for Modeling**: Establish a clear understanding of the dataset that will inform subsequent steps in modeling or hypothesis testing.

This document serves as a guide for anyone looking to replicate or extend this analysis in their own projects.
