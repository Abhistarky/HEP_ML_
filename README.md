This repository contains codes to know the cern_Jet and particle_dataset and the result of different deep learning model operations on it. 
The dataset used by this repository belongs to Maurizi Pierinim.
More deep learning applications like graph neural network and anomoly detection will be added later to this repository. 
To know more about the dataset please refer to the following Link:- https://zenodo.org/record/3602260#.YvJ9U3ZBxr9

The HIGGS signal and Background dataset has been taken from Sanu Varghese's git repo. I do not hold any credit for the dataset.
