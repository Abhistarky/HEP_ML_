# RNN for Jet Tagging Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the architecture and methodology used in the "RNN_FOR_JET_TAGGING" analysis. The primary goal of this analysis is to utilize Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for tagging jets in particle physics, which is crucial for identifying and classifying particles resulting from high-energy collisions.

## Purpose of the Analysis

The RNN model is designed to process sequences of data, making it suitable for tasks where temporal or sequential relationships are significant. In the context of jet tagging, the model aims to analyze sequences of features derived from jets to accurately classify them.

## Key Components of the RNN Architecture

### 1. **Input Layer**

- **Data Representation**: The input consists of sequences representing jet features. Each sequence may include various attributes such as momentum, energy, and spatial coordinates.

### 2. **Recurrent Layers**

- **Sequence Processing**: The core of the RNN architecture includes one or more recurrent layers that process the input sequences. Key characteristics include:
  - **Hidden States**: The RNN maintains hidden states that capture information from previous time steps, allowing it to learn temporal dependencies.
  - **Gated Mechanisms**: Variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) may be employed to better manage long-range dependencies and mitigate issues like vanishing gradients.

### 3. **Activation Functions**

- **Non-linearity**: After processing through recurrent layers, activation functions such as Tanh or ReLU are applied to introduce non-linearity into the model, enhancing its ability to learn complex patterns.

### 4. **Output Layer**

- **Classification**: The final output layer generates predictions regarding jet tags. This could involve:
  - Softmax activation for multi-class classification tasks.
  - Binary output for distinguishing between two types of jets.

## Training Process

- The RNN model is trained using labeled data relevant to jet tagging. A loss function appropriate for classification tasks (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) is used to evaluate performance, while optimization algorithms (like Adam) adjust model parameters during training.

## Conclusion

The "RNN_FOR_JET_TAGGING" analysis leverages the strengths of Recurrent Neural Networks to effectively classify jets based on sequential data. By capturing temporal relationships within jet features, the RNN model aims to improve tagging accuracy in particle physics applications.
